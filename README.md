# dexie-worker

dexie-worker is an extension package for <a href="https://dexie.org/" target="_blank">Dexie.js</a> that enables Dexie to work seamlessly in a Web Worker environment, allowing for smoother handling of IndexedDB operations without blocking the main thread. This package provides an easy way to enhance your Dexie-based applications with Web Worker support, along with a convenient React hook for live query subscriptions.

## Features

- **Web Worker Integration**: Run Dexie.js in a Web Worker to improve app performance and responsiveness.
- **React Hook Support**: Use `useLiveQuery` to fetch and subscribe to live data changes, optimized for a Web Worker context.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install dexie-worker
```

## Usage

To get started with dexie-worker, import `getWebWorkerDB` to set up Dexie in a Web Worker context and enjoy a non-blocking database experience.

### Basic Setup

1. Define Your Dexie Database: Create a Dexie subclass or use a function-based approach to define your database schema.
2. Initialize with Web Worker: Use `getWebWorkerDB` to enable Web Worker functionality for your Dexie instance.

#### Example 1: Function-Based Dexie Database

Here’s a basic setup for integrating dexie-worker in your Dexie project using a function-based approach:

```javascript
import Dexie from "dexie";
import { getWebWorkerDB } from "dexie-worker";

// Define a function-based Dexie instance
function createDatabase() {
  const db = new Dexie("MyDatabase");
  db.version(1).stores({
    products: "++id, name"
  });
  return db;
}

const _db = createDatabase();
_db.open(); // initialize database
// Initialize with Web Worker DB insance
const db = getWebWorkerDB(createDatabase());
```

Now, `db` will run on a separate thread, keeping your main UI thread responsive and free from database-related tasks.

#### Example 2: Class-Based Dexie Database

Alternatively, you can integrate `dexie-worker` in your Dexie project with a class-based approach.

```javascript
import Dexie from "dexie";
import { getWebWorkerDB } from "dexie-worker";

// Define your Dexie subclass
class MyDatabase extends Dexie {
  constructor() {
    super("MyDatabase");
    this.version(1).stores({
      users: "++id, name"
    });
  }
}

const _db = new MyDatabase();
_db.open(); // initialize database
// Initialize with Web Worker support
const db = getWebWorkerDB(_db);
```

With this setup, you're free to use a function-based approach to organize and create multiple Dexie instances or handle conditional setups within your application.

### React Hook: useLiveQuery

dexie-worker also provides a convenient `useLiveQuery` hook for React applications, which allows you to subscribe to live query updates from the database.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Unlike the default usage in `dexie-react-hooks`, you'll need to pass the `db` instance within the callback function.

#### Usage Example

```javascript
import { useLiveQuery } from "dexie-worker";

// IMPORTANT: use "db" returned from the callback function
const userDetails = useLiveQuery((db) => db.users.get({ id: 1 }));

// userDetails will automatically update when data changes
```

By wrapping `db` in the callback function, `useLiveQuery` efficiently maintains real-time updates in your React components, utilizing the Web Worker's isolated environment.

### Custom Live Queries
For advanced usage, dexie-worker exports the liveQuery function, allowing you to create your own custom live queries outside of React components.
#### Example of a Custom Live Query
```js
import { liveQuery } from "dexie-worker";

// Create a custom live query
const userLiveData = liveQuery((db) => db.users.where("age").above(18).toArray());

// Subscription to the live query
userLiveData.subscribe({
  next: (data) => console.log("User data updated:", data),
  error: (error) => console.error("Live query error:", error),
});
```

### Content Security Policies
This library uses code injection to execute the web worker, which may not comply with [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) if your website uses one. To ensure CSP compliance, please follow the [Generate Web Worker File section](#generate-web-worker-file).
### Generate Web Worker File
To generate a web worker file, execute the following 
```bash
generate-dexie-worker
```
This command generates a web worker file based on your project configuration. The file  needs to be placed in a publicly accessible location (e.g. http://localhost/dexieWorker.js)

To initialize the Dexie worker with the generated file:
```js
const db = getWebWorkerDB(dexieDb, {
  workerUrl: '/dexieWorker.js' // the path can be different based on your environment
});
```
This will no longer use code injection.

### Custom Operations
You can create custom operations to run within the web worker to improve performance and extend support to cases that are otherwise unsupported due to limitations in communicating with the web worker, such as the inability to pass callbacks (e.g., with methods like [each](https://dexie.org/docs/Collection/Collection.each())).
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Create a `dexie-worker.config.js`(or `.ts`) file with your custom operations:
```ts
import Dexie from "dexie";
import map from "lodash.map"; // you can use external libraries

export default {
  operations: {
    async runBulkOperationInWorkerExample(dexie: Dexie, arg1: any, arg2: any) {
      const oldUsers = await dexie.users.toArray();

      const newUsers = map(oldUsers, user => ({
        ...user,
        isActive: true,
      }));

      await dexie.transaction('rw', dexie.usersV2, async () => {
        await dexie.usersV2.bulkPut(newUsers);
      });

      return 'A seralizable result' // e.g Objects, Arrays, Strings, etc. To learn more about not supported types refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#things_that_dont_work_with_structured_clone
    },
    // ...other methods
  }
}
```
2. Generate the web worker file:
```bash
generate-dexie-worker ./path/to/dexie-worker.config.js
```
Note: The command automatically detects your Dexie version from package.json, but you can specify a version manually:
```bash
npx generate-dexie-worker ./path/to/dexie-worker.config.js "3.2.2"
```
3. Place the generated file in a publicly accessible location(e.g. http://localhost/dexieWorker.js)
4. initialize the dexie worker with the following options:
```js
const db = getWebWorkerDB(dexieDb, {
  workerUrl: '/dexieWorker.js' // the path can be different based on your environment
});
```
5. Call your custom operations:
```js
const result = db.operation('runBulkOperationInWorkerExample', arg1, arg2)
```
